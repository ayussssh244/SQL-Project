📌 Project Overview
This project involves analyzing an airline database using SQL. It includes a series of complex queries designed to extract meaningful insights related to flight operations, passenger details, seat allocation, airport performance, and more.

🔍 Dataset
The project utilizes the Airline DB, which contains tables related to:

Flights: Flight schedules, delays, and cancellations

Passengers: Passenger details and booking records

Tickets & Bookings: Transaction records of booked flights

Airports & Aircrafts: Information on departure/arrival locations and airplane models

Boarding Passes: Seat allocation and check-in details

🛠️ SQL Queries Implemented
Key SQL operations performed in this project include:

Date Formatting: Representing booking dates in a human-readable format

Joins & Aggregations: Combining multiple tables to retrieve useful insights

Window Functions: Ranking and partitioning data for advanced analysis

CTEs & Subqueries: Efficient query structuring for readability

Filtering & Sorting: Identifying patterns in flights, passengers, and airports

📊 Key Insights Extracted
✔️ Identified the highest and lowest paying passengers per month
✔️ Found the least allocated seat numbers
✔️ Counted tickets without boarding passes
✔️ Retrieved details of longest flights and earliest departures
✔️ Listed airports with maximum and minimum departures
✔️ Analyzed flight cancellations based on aircraft type
✔️ Extracted details of return and non-stop journeys
✔️ Identified flights within a specific range (3,000-6,000 km)
✔️ Determined customers eligible for refunds due to flight cancellations
